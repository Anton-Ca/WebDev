Author: Anton Carlsson
Course: DA557A ST22
Solution to: The one with the labyrinth
Examination: 1
Comment: I know you can do the lab even with a similar solution without numpy,
but I'm just more used to the syntax, hope that's ok. Also I got tired of making
doc-strings for this lab, but check out Lab1_3 for some cool doc-strings.
